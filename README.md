# easyansi
*A simple library to make ansi easier and to help with other things that ANSI can do*

## What is ANSI?
An ANSI escape sequence is a standard for in-band signaling to control things such as color, font, cursor location, or even key presses. this is a bad explanation though, check out the wikipedia article [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code).


## Install
(I will upload it to NPM when I can, but for now you're stuck with downloading the file and putting it with your project)

1. download easyansi.js
2. put it in wherever you need it to
3. refrence it in your js file (eg: `const easyansi = require("./easyansi.js");` )
4. you're good to go
